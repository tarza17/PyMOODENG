Features
=========================

The current working features, that can be used:

- Ability to define custom planetary systems and celestial bodies
- Simple visualization tools for simulation results

Other features, that are in developement:

- Support for  orbital mechanics calculations (Code implmeneted, but does not work properly with dynamic plotting)
- Support of  a rudementary fuel calualtion system (Reliant on orbital mechanics calculations)
- True gravitational attraction calculations, and representation 
- Many more features, that my appear as bugs, but are actually features
- A lot of bugs, that are not features
